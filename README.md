I create <b>Student Management Form</b> with using C# for Beykoz University. In its content, it is the <b>admin panel</b> that only the authorities will use for the student and course management system.
In addition to adding and deleting students and adding and deleting courses, I also keep the grades of the student from the course in the database.
